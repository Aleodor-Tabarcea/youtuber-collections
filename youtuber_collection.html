    <h2>Thank you for using Youtuber Collection</h2>
    <span>Long has it been since YouTube allowed us to group out subscriptions, but worry not, The Extension Guy is here to help you. <br>
        This handy little extension will make grouping your subscriptions in collections a breeze and what's more, you can take with you anywhere. <br>
        Simply login to any Chrome Browser with your Google account, install this extension and your collections are there with you! <br>
        Neat, right?</span>
    <br>
    <span>Here are a few of the functionalities:</span>
    <ul>
        <li>Simply fill in a name in the "New collection" input to create a new collection</li>
        <li>Add subscriptions to your collection by simply dragging them over the collection name or using the send to option on each subscription</li>
        <li>Remove a collection by dragging it over the 'New collection' input that will become the trash bin</li>
        <li>Remove a subscription from a collection by simply dragging it outside the scope of the collection</li>
    </ul>
    <br>
    <span><strong>Note:</strong> This is an early version of the extension working only for the "Classic Theme" of youtube, this will not work for the moment if you use the new interface. No collections will be lost in the upgrading process but bugs and visuals will be improved, so please keep up to date.</span>
